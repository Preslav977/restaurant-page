## 2. Objective

The objective was to create an restaurant page with using the technologies of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Webpack.

The object was divided with three files, using ES6 modules to create three pages which the restaurant page has,

the first one was the home page, that is going to load when then the restaurant page is loaded, the second one

contains the menu of the page, and the third one is the contact page.

The project is also shows, how to tab switch different content of the restaurant page, when the user decides to

go from one page to the other, this was done with deleting the content of the div, and then is called new function

which will generate depending on the li element clicked, for example when user clicks 1, deletes home page then a

function is called that creates the menu, the objective is also teaching how use webpack

## 3. My personal objectives

The project was simple and fun, then only thing i did dislike, is creating everything with JavaScript,

using webpack is fun also, he can be used to import styles on different files (modules), fonts, pictures and so on.

## 4. Notes and lessons learned

I learned what is webpack and what is his purpose in web development, about ES6 modules, that are used to divide

the logic of the project in different files, so can be easily read, the logic is separated also which makes it

easier to work, learned about switching tabs logic which can also be used on next project.

## 5. Things to improve when visiting the project

The things i would like to improve is, the code right now everything is all over the place, instead of clean, easy
